## Requirements

You are creating a sneaker brand application using Angular. Your application must:

- Allow users to add a new sneaker model.
- Every sneaker must-have model name (string), price (number), special edition (boolean), author (string), creation date (Date), and artist collaborator (string).
- Every field must be validated. Artist collaborator is an optional field but if is a special edition it must have an artist collaborator.
- When a new sneaker is created you have to store it in a database and show it on a list page. Note: You can skip this step by adding it to a list below the form for simplicity.
- You have to use material components in the design.
